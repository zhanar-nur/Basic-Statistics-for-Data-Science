# Basic Statistics for Data Science

## Introduction

### Goal
There are three main areas of Data Science: statistics/mathematics, programming and domain knowledge. Data Science is the study that provides different forms of assumptions about tendencies, and that is why the information needs to be organized according to the concepts of statistics in order to ensure accurate findings. The statistics plays a powerful role while dealing with big data, and that is why this analysis will demonstrate the Basic Statistics used in the Data Science. This is purely for display purposes, but can be useful notes.

### Motivation
This analysis is my practice to master Basic Statistics for Data Science techniques, which are fundamental steps to ensure accurate findings.

### Data
Stroke Prediction Dataset will be used for the analysis. The dataset is public and available in Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

### Libraries
You need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- math

### Summary
This analysis is purely for display purposes of Basic Statistics, but can be useful for Data Science Analysis.
